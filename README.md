# computation-service-using-remote-procedure-call-RPC-based-communication

It's a simple java code.
Can use any IDE - I used IntelliJ IDEA.
Java version - Any version of java 8 later. I used 11.0.17.

How to run:
  * Import the attached file in any IDE to run in ease way.
  * Before compile change the server and client, set server and client directory ( Server side folder and Client side folder) path according to your system. Code Line number - 17 and 20th line in ProjectRPCImpl.java
  * Change the upload file directory - where upload file locates. Code Line number - 75th line in ClientRPC.java
  * Start with the ServerRPC.java
  * Once ServerRPC class compiled successfully then run the ClientRPC.java file.

  Note: I placed sample.txt for testing purpose. Use any file less than 10mb for standard IDE and system performance to ignore latency(based on cache allocated for the IDE).
